Dohd (pron. doh-dee) is a minimalist DNS-over-HTTPS daemon that redirects all DoH queries
to a traditional DNS server open to UDP queries.

## Features

- Support for RFC8484 DNS-over-HTTPS (POST and GET method) - HTTP/2
- Record freshness derived from minimum TTL among answers
- Optimized and readable C code below 1500 locs
- Privacy focused, no logs are kept

***
# üíæ Install

Build system requirements: gcc or clang, GNU make

1. Ensure that [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfssl) is
installed on your system, and configured to support TLS 1.3 (configure
option: `--enable-tls13` or simply `--enable-all`).

2. Type `make`.

3. Executable will be found in `./src/dohd`

***
# üéÆ Quick start

Commands must be issued as root on the host machine.

Generate a fake local certificate for testing:

```
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/test.key -out /etc/test.csr \
    -subj "/C=IT/ST=Rome/L=Rome/O=Local Host/OU=Testing Department/CN=example.com" \
    && openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 \
    -in /etc/test.csr -signkey /etc/test.key -out /etc/test.crt
```

Create a dohd user and grant it access to certificates
```
adduser -D -H -s /bin/false dohd
chown dohd:dohd /etc/test.*
```

Start dohd as root to proxy all queries to a public dns and drop privileges to dohd user

```
dohd -c /etc/test.crt -k /etc/test.key -p 8053 -d 8.8.8.8 -u dohd -F
```

***
# üîß Configuration

There are several browsers compatible with DNS over HTTPS (DoH). The instructions below let you setup their connection to our demo server dns.dyne.org in order to protect your DNS queries from privacy intrusions and tampering.

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://dyne.github.io/dohd/#/Configure?id=mozilla-firefox)
- [Google Chrome](https://dyne.github.io/dohd/#/Configure?id=google-chrome)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://dyne.github.io/dohd/#/Configure?id=microsoft-edge)
- [Brave](https://dyne.github.io/dohd/#/Configure?id=brave)


## dohd daemon

Commandline options are few, help is shown using `-h`

```
Usage: dohd -c cert -k key [-p port] [-d dnsserver] [-F] [-u user] [-V] [-v] [-h]

	'cert' and 'key': certificate and its private key.
	'user' : login name (when running as root) to switch to (dropping permissions)
	Default values: port=8053 dnsserver="::1"
	Use '-h' for help
	Use '-V' to show version
	Use '-v' for verbose mode
	Use '-F' for foreground mode
```

- '-c *certificate*' - specifies which certificate for the TLS server. (Mandatory parameter)
- '-k *private-key*' - specifies the private key used by the TLS server. (Mandatory parameter)
- '-p *port*' - changes the listening port for the DoH service (default:8053)
- '-u *user*' - drop root privileges after binding to the TCP port by switching user (mandatory when running as root)
- '-F' - runs dohd in foreground (instead of creating a daemon)
